          <p>
            An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus
            domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most
            widely grown species in the genus Malus.

          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            The center of diversity of the genus Malus is in eastern present-day
            Turkey. The apple tree may have been the earliest tree that humans
            cultivated, and growers have improved its fruits through selection
            over thousands of years. Alexander the Great is credited with
            finding dwarfed apples in Kazakhstan in 328 BCE.

          <h2>Uses</h2>
          <p>
            Apples are milled or pressed to produce apple juice, which may be
            drunk unfiltered (called apple cider in North America), or filtered.
            Filtered juice is often concentrated and frozen, then reconstituted
            later and consumed. Apple juice can be fermented to make cider
            (called hard cider in North America), ciderkin, and vinegar.
